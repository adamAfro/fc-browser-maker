# Wordlsummary

**Functionalities**:

- [x] selecting any node of a website to do stuff on it
    - right now it just counts words 
- [x] showing word summary
- [x] highlighting summarised text after clicking summary
- [ ] showing as popup

---

I had some issues...

Why not show something in:

- browser popup - disappears after clicking on the page ❌
- browser sidepanel - is not supported by some browsers ❌
- window popup - another window?! ❌
- website custom sidepanel... ✅
